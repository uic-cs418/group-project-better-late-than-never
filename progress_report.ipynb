Ultimately we decided clustering wasn't the right approach due to insufficient variables within the dataset. During our EDA we discovered a strong bias in the Yelp review data. The bias was that most reviews are either 1-star or 5-star, with not much in between. This interesting pattern affects how we analyze and model the data going forward. "
